things to fix:

- new summoner cat thing warp to prontera on start... somehow get skills to work?
- turn off chat flooding prevention thingy
- use client in one directory from projects using .gitignore
- update magician hat with good stats.
- increase book range to 4... some books 5, best books 6.
- get rid of skill requirements so pick whaqtever skills you want!
- add more anubis to sphinx 4/5
- setup client so that .gitignore is used to be able to play directly from projects/client folder... i.e. .gitignore will ignore all of the computer specific details for easy pushes and pulls on all clients

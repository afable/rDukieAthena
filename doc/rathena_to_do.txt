things to fix:

- new summoner cat thing warp to prontera on start... somehow get skills to work?
- get rid of skill requirements so pick whatever skills you want! (didn't work in rathena/conf/battle/player.conf.... so maybe if you want more skills just allocate more skill points?
- undo changes to xampp configuration to allow only local connections... for security purposes.
-*** SET ROUTER TO KEEP A STATIC IP ADDRESS FOR SERVER COMPUTER!
- learn how to version control large files in git... keep receiving error

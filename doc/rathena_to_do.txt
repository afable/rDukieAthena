things to fix:

- new summoner cat thing warp to prontera on start... somehow get skills to work?
- get rid of skill requirements so pick whaqtever skills you want! (didn't work in rathena/conf/battle/player.conf.... so maybe if you want more skills just allocate more skill points?
- setup client so that .gitignore is used to be able to play directly from projects/client folder... i.e. .gitignore will ignore all of the computer specific details for easy pushes and pulls on all clients
-*** SET ROUTER TO KEEP A STATIC IP ADDRESS FOR SERVER COMPUTER!
